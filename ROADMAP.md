### Story Point Key

(1) Trivial amount of work, something you have done before, no more than 15 min of work

(2) Something easy, UI/State change only, no more than 30 min of work

(3) Something involved, HTTP/large UI changes, around an hour of work

(5) Big feature, pulling in new libraries, new pages/screens, more than a nights worth of work
